        indicate how to find neighbors (from the point of the reverse/maxflow
        graph with the root on the bottom), which is one of descendant (only
        children and descendents), ancestor (only parents and ancestors), or all

    neighbor_embedding_weights:
      doc: >-
        weights used to scale each neighbor from the the current node and
        immediate neighbor to the furthest neighbor; if there is only one
        entry, the singleton value is multiplied by the respective nodes
        embeddings

        the slope for the linear dampening of nodes under a sentence by
        sentence cosine similarity; the higher the value the lower the sentence
        similarity, which leads to lower concept and attribute node
        similarities
